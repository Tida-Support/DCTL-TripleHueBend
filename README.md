# Davinci Resolve DCTL: TripleHueBend

This DCTL operates similarly to a magnetic field for colors, enabling colors to shift rapidly toward up to three selected target hues. This results in a unique "push-pull" effect on color distribution, allowing colors to be attracted to or repelled from these target hues based on user-defined parameters.

## Target Hues and Their Significance
At the heart of this DCTL are its intuitive controls, allowing for precise customization of target hues:

- Target Hue 1 (18.5): This hue represents a skintone within the HSL color space, providing a solid foundation for naturalistic color adjustments.
- Target Hue 2 (198.5): Directly opposite in the color wheel, this hue creates a strong contrast.
- Target Hue 3 (98.5): A preset green hue, useful for introducing further tones.

Each of these target hues can be adjusted through sliders, making it easy to define their influence in grading.

## Blend Weight Control
Each hue selection is paired with a Blend Weight slider, which allows colorists to tune the strength of each hue's influence. These sliders range from -1.0 to 1.0, enabling control over how strongly colors are drawn toward or pushed away from the designated target hues.

##Saturation Controls for Each Hue
To further refine the behavior of each target hue, new Saturation controls have been added:
- Sat 1: Controls the saturation impact for Target Hue 1. This slider ranges from 0.0 to 2.0, enabling nuanced control over how saturated or muted the skintone target becomes.
- Sat 2: Allows for saturation adjustments on Target Hue 2, influencing how much the opposite hue stands out or recedes.
- Sat 3: Manages saturation for Target Hue 3, which can add vibrancy or softness to green tones.

## Saturation and Luminance Dynamics
The DCTL also incorporates controls for adjusting saturation and luminance dynamics:

### Saturation control
- Saturation Power: Initially set at 2.0, this slider determines how much saturation influences the blending process, enhancing the push-pull dynamics.
- Saturation Slope: This slider allows for further refinement of the blending curve based on saturation, enabling either smooth or aggressive transitions in color adjustments.

### Luminance control:
- Luminance Power: Influences how brightness impacts blending behavior.
- Luminance Slope: Modifies the blending curve based on luminance, allowing for nuanced brightness adjustments.

### Swirl Feature
Additionally, the DCTL includes a Swirl checkbox that enables a unique "swirl" behavior in hue adjustments. When activated, this feature introduces a circular bending effect around the target hues.

### Skip Hue 3 Feature
The addition of the Skip Hue 3 checkbox allows for quick exclusion of the third hue from the color shift. When enabled, Target Hue 3 is skipped, and no color adjustments are made to that particular hue, simplifying the grading process when the third hue isn't required.

## Exclusion of Neutral Colors
Importantly, the Triple-Hue-Bend DCTL is designed to exclude the influence of neutral colorsâ€”namely white, gray, and black. This ensures that the focus remains on vibrant color adjustments without interference from these neutral tones, allowing for more precise control over the color palette.
