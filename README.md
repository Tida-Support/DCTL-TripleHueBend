# DCTL-TripleHueBlend
This DCTL operates similarly to a magnetic field for colors, enabling them to shift rapidly toward up to three selected target hues. This results in a unique "push-pull" effect on color distribution, allowing colors to be attracted to or repelled from these hues based on user-defined parameters.
